# eirini-board
KiCad project for an heart shaped PCB with ESP32, TFT display, battery and more

## SIZES!!

I printed one time with default pin and pad diameters and they were all too small.

But the ones that were in the ESP32 footprint were right (I didn't make it obv) which were:

- 1.27mm hole diameter
- 1.905mm pad diameter
